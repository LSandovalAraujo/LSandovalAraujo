- Hi! I’m @LSandovalAraujo - you can find me on the same handle on Twitter and Mastodon. 
- I'm a graduate student at the University of Louisville's Eating Anxiety Treatment (EAT) Lab working on the Predicting Recovery study.
- I've written a lot of code for our ongoing project analyzing ecological momentary assessment and sensor data to be used in machine learning. 
- I'll be adding some code periodically here as I learn the ways of Python and R.
